This is a fork of github.com/nafg/reactive library. It adds support for working with Google Web Toolkit.

reactive-gwt-demo is a demo project
It uses unreleased versions of Scala and GWT. The quickest way to setup a working build was ant. So to build it you need to run 'ant' inside 'reactive-gwt-demo/lib', and then run 'ant' inside 'reactive-gwt-demo'. You can also run "ant devmode" to run the demo in GWT devmode.
